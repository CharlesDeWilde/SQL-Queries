-# Using the same data from the Movie Store, I wanted to create a Common Table Expression (or a CTE) to showcase some more film data findings. 
    
-# This query now retrieves film data from a my Movie Rental Store Database, filtering films released in or after 2005. 
-# It then creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named "FilmData" to organize and simplify the displayed data. 
-# Finally, the main query selects specific film attributes from the CTE, showcasing essential information such as movie title, release year, rental cost, runtime, replacement fee, and rating.
